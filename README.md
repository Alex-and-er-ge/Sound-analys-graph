#Simple code to visualise sound from mic in real time

One way to perform spectral analysis in Python is by using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). This is a method that allows us to analyze the frequency content of a signal by dividing it into overlapping time frames, computing the Fourier Transform (FT) of each frame, and then examining the magnitude of the resulting frequency spectrum.

Here's an example of how you can compute the STFT of a signal in Python using the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries

This will generate a plot of the magnitude spectrum of the test signal from pc microphone, which shows the strength of the different frequency components that make up the signal. You can adjust the parameters of the STFT, such as the length of the FFT window and the overlap between frames, to fine-tune the frequency resolution and time resolution of the spectral analysis.
